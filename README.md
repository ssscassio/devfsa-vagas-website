# Website for open source ideas

This is a simple website I set up to get the latest ideas (submitted in the form of issues to open-source-ideas/open-source-ideas) shown in a simple manner on a website.

The website uses materializecss for the front-end, so we could focus more on the logic of the website, rather than the design.

All the logic on the website is handled through js (version 6 to be specific), removing the need for a real back-end, and hence we could host it using GitHub pages.
The raw data is retrieved through GitHubs own API, and then parsed using javascript, so we could display it in a bit nicer manner.

As a matter of fact, making a website for the project was actually submitted as an idea.
